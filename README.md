# 🔊 The Study Buddy Audio Project

## 👋 Introduction

Hello! We are students from **Green River College** in Auburn, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. This project is about making learning more efficient and accessible, especially for those in technical fields.

## 🧐 The Problem: Time and Distraction

Have you ever found yourself **wasting time** watching videos or listening to non-educational audio when you should be focused on learning for your classes or career?

As software engineering students, we realized how much time is lost to distraction. We thought: **"What if we could use that time—like when commuting, exercising, or doing chores—to listen to our course material?"**

### The Existing Options are Limiting:

* **Speechify:** Turns text into audio, but it's **expensive** and doesn't let you customize **how** the technical text is read. (E.g., it might read a code snippet incorrectly).
* **ElevenLabs:** Cheaper and offers customization, but it **doesn't automatically prepare the text** for you. You have to manually edit every book or article, which defeats the purpose of saving time.

## 💡 The Solution: Customized, Affordable Audio

We set out to create a better way!

The **Study Buddy Audio Project** aims to find a way to **automatically customize** the text before it's turned into audio. This allows for:

1.  **Correct Pronunciation:** Ensuring technical terms, code snippets, or formulas are read out clearly and accurately.
2.  **Affordable Cost:** Offering a solution that is much more reasonably priced than the expensive alternatives.
3.  **Hands-Free Learning:** Allowing students and professionals to absorb complex material while multitasking.

### The Goal:

Our ultimate task is to build a system that **automatically prepares and customizes educational text** (like textbooks or articles) and then converts it into high-quality, customized audio, all at a fair price.
